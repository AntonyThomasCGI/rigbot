- ctrl nulls are all grey outliner colour so are invisible except the visibility nulls which could have override controls
for the visibility of ctrls under them

- have attrs on BIND save out to settings loc or something as dict in string

	-builder could have selected and PyNode-like classes to transform selected module roots into class objects

- could consider moving tag() and display() functions out of ScaffoldBase

layout bit of a mess:
    > probably shouldn't be two ways to make scaffold?
    > selected() doesnt make much sense in builder... maybe utils should somehow import into the rb namespace ?? then
      add selected() to that
^>actually would be nice if everything imported from one import :thinking:

> turned off statement has no effect inspection so >> // works but might want to check later

dict_filter = lambda x, y: dict([(i, x[i]) for i in x if i in y])  # nice

maybe name is component not module :thinking:


!dont name module names inputs outputs with just "input" "output"
